    "# The language of Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is the science that seeks to understand the fundamental workings of the universe: from the motion of everyday objects to the structure of atoms and galaxies. To do this, physicists have developed a precise and powerful language: one that combines mathematics, both colloquial and technical language, and visual representations. This language allows us not only to describe how the physical world behaves, but also to predict how it will behave under new conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce the foundational elements of this language, covering how to express physical ideas using equations, graphs, diagrams, and words. You’ll also get a first taste of how physics uses numerical simulations as an essential complement to analytical problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This language is more than just a set of tools—it is how physicists *think*. Mastering it is the first step in becoming fluent in physics."

    "## Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics problems and concepts can be represented in multiple ways, each offering a different perspective and set of insights. The ability to translate between these representations is one of the most important skills you will develop as a physics student. In this section, we examine three key forms of representation: equations, graphs and drawings, and verbal descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the context of a hail stone falling from the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verbal descriptions\n",
    "Words are indispensable in physics. Language is used to describe a phenomenon, explain concepts, pose problems and interpret results. A good verbal description makes clear:\n",
    "- What is happening in a physical scenario\n",
    "- What assumptions are being made (e.g., frictionless surface, constant mass)\n",
    "- What is known and what needs to be found\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let us consider a small hail stone that comes falling out of the sky. We will assume that the hail stone is formed in a cloud at a height of 1km above the ground. Furthermore, we will take that the stone drops from that height with zero initial velocity. Finally, we will assume that the problem is 1-dimensional: the hail stone drops vertically down and experiences only gravity, buoyancy and air-friction. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual representations\n",
    "Visual representations help us interpret physical behavior at a glance. Graphs, motion diagrams, free-body diagrams, and vector sketches are all ways to make abstract ideas more concrete.\n",
    "- **Graphs** (e.g., position vs. time, velocity vs. time) reveal trends and allow for estimation of slopes and areas, which have physical meanings like velocity and displacement.\n",
    "- **Drawings** help illustrate the situation: what objects are involved, how they are moving, and what forces act on them.\n",

    "## Math: Notes on vector notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Position, velocity, momentum, force: they are all vectors. In physics we will use vectors a lot. It is important to use a proper notation to indicate that you are working with a vector. That can be done in various ways, all of which you will probably use at some point in time. We will use the position of a particle located at point P as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position vector\n",
    "We write the position**vector** of the particle as $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "This vector is a 'thing', it exists in space independent of the coordinate system we use. All we need is an origin that defines the starting point of the vector and the point P, where the vector ends.  \n",
    "A coordinate system allows us to write a representation of the vector in terms of its coordinates. For instance, we could use the familiar Cartesian Coordinate system {x,y,x} and represent $\\vec{r}$ as a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "          x \\\\\n",
    "          y \\\\\n",
    "          z\n",
    "    \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could use unit vectors in the x, y and z-direction. These vectors have unit length and point in the x, y or z-direction, respectively. They are denoted in varies ways, depending on taste. Here are 3 examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split}\n",
    "\\hat{x},\\;\\; \\hat{i}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_x \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y},\\;\\; \\hat{j}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_y \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{z},\\;\\; \\hat{k}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_z\n",
    "\\end{split} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation, we can write the position vector $\\vec{r}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split}\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\hat{x} \\;+ y \\hat{y} \\;+ z \\hat{z} \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\hat{i}\\;\\; + y \\hat{j}\\; + z \\hat{k} \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\vec{e}_x + y \\vec{e}_y + z \\vec{e}_z\n",
    "\\end{split} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are completely equivalent: the difference is in how the unit vectors are named. Also note, that these three representations are all given in terms of vectors. That is important to realize: in contrast to the column notation, now all is written at a single line. But keep in mind: $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ are perpendicular **vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiating a vector \n",
    "\n",
    "We often have to differentiate physical quantities: velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time; acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. But you will also come across differentiation with respect to position.  \n",
    "As an example, let's take velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{v} \\equiv \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean? Differentiating is looking at the change of your 'function' when you go from $x$ to $x+dx$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{dx} \\equiv \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x ) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3 dimensions we will have that we go from point P, represented by $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z}$ to 'the next point' $\\vec{r} + d\\vec{r}$. The small vector $d\\vec{r}$ is a small step forward in all three directions, that is a bit $dx$ in the x-direction, a bit $dy$ in the y-direction and a bit $dz$ in the z-direction.  \n",
    "Consequently, we can write $\\vec{r} + d\\vec{r}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r} + d\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z} + dx\\hat{dx} + dy\\hat{y} + dz\\hat{z} $$\n",
    "$$= (x+dx)\\hat{x} + (y+dy)\\hat{y} + (z+dz)\\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can take a look at each component of the position and define the velocity component as, e.g., in the x-direction\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_x = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{x(t + \\Delta t ) - x(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to the 3-dimensional vector, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\vec{v} \\equiv \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left ( x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z} \\right ) \\\\\n",
    " &=\\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x} + \\frac{dy}{dt}\\hat{y} + \\frac{dz}{dt}\\hat{z} \\\\\n",
    " &= v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y} + v_z \\hat{z}\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above, we have used that according to the product rule: $\\frac{d}{dt} (x\\hat{x} ) = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x} + x\\frac{d\\hat{x}}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x}$, since $\\frac{d\\hat{x}}{dt} = 0$ (the unit vectors in a Cartesian system are constant). This may sound trivial: how could they change; they have always length 1 and they always point in the same direction. Trivial as this may be, we will come across unit vectors that are not constant as their direction may change. But we will worry about those examples later.\n",

    "### A further note on notation: differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical phenomena are described by differential equations. That may be because a system evolves in time or because it changes from location to location. In our treatment of the principles of classical mechanics, we will use differentiation with respect to time a lot. The reason is obviously found in Newton's $2^{nd}$ law: $F = ma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The acceleration $a$ is the derivative of the velocity with respect to time; velocity in itself is the derivative of position with respect to time. Or when we use the equivalent formulation with momentum: $\\frac{dp}{dt} = F$. So the change of momentum in time is due to forces. Again, we using differentiation, but now of momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three common ways to denote differentiation. The first one is by 'spelling it out': \n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\frac{dx}{dt} \\text{   and } a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantage: it is crystal clear what we are doing.\n",
    "- Disadvantage: it is a rather lengthy way of writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton introduced a different flavor: he used a dot above the quantity to indicate differentiation with respect to time. So,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\dot{x}, \\text{   or } a = \\dot{v} = \\ddot{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantage: compact notation, keeping equations compact.\n",
    "- Disadvantage: a dot is easily overlooked or disappears in the writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in math often the prime is used: $\\frac{df}{dx} = f'(x)$ or $\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = f''(x)$.\n",
    "Similar advantage and disadvantage as with the dot notation.\n",
