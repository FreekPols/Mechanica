title: Introducing Classical Mechanics & Special Relativity
site:
  hide_title_block: true

abstract: This book provides an introduction for freshman students into the world of classical mechanics and special relativity theory. Much of physics is build on the basic ideas from classical mechanics. Hence an early introduction to the topic can be beneficial for new students. However, at the start of studying physics, lots of the required math is not available yet. That means that all kind of concepts that are very useful can not be invoked in the lectures and teaching. That does not have to be a disadvantage. It can also be used to help the students by introducing some math and coupling it directly to the physics, making more clear why mathematics should be studied and what its 'practical use' is. With this book, we aim to introduce new students directly at the start of their studies into the world of physics, more specifically the world of Newton, Galilei and many others who laid the foundation of physics. We aim to help students getting a good understanding of the theory, i.e. the framework of physics. What is 'work' and why do we use it? Why is kinetic energy $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ and not $\frac{1}{3}mv^2$ or $\frac{1}{2}mv^3$? Both 3's are fundamentally wrong, but what is behind it?

# About this book

Classical mechanics is the starting point of physics. Over the centuries, via [Newton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) three fundamental laws formulated around 1687, we have built a solid framework describing the material world around us. On these pages, you will find a text book with animations, demos and exercises for studying introductory classical mechanics. Moreover, we will consider the first steps of [Einstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) Special Theory of Relativity published 1905.

This material is made to support first year students from the BSc Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology during their course *Classical Mechanics and Relativity Theory*, MechaRela for short. But, of course, anybody interested in Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity is more than welcome to use this book.

With this e-book our aim is to provide learning material that is:

* self-contained
* easy to modify and thus improve over the years
* interactive, provide additional demos and exercises next to the lectures

## Authors

* Prof.Dr. Robert F. Mudde, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology
* Prof.Dr. Bernd Rieger, Department of Imaging Physics, Delft University of Technology
* Dr. Freek Pols, Science & Engineering Education, Delft University of Technology

## Exercises

Each chapter includes a variety of exercises tailored to the material. We distinguish between exercises embedded within the instructional text and those presented on separate pages. The in-text exercises should be completed while reading, as they offer immediate feedback on whether the concepts and mathematics are understood. The separate exercise sets are intended for practice after reading the text and attending the lectures.

To indicate the level of difficulty, each exercise is marked with 1, 2, or 3 &#127798;
