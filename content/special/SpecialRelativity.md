  Instead of including rigid bodies, we opted for Special Relativity as the part of the course. In our opinion it is very stimulating for freshmen students to dive into the fascinating world of Einstein and his Relativity Theory. Moreover, Special Relativity is mathematically 'light', but it has strange, counterintuitive consequences. Via these, we can show that it is really beneficial to work with a solid framework and to follow a rigorous approach when dealing with questions and problems. It helps to leave the High School approach - which is understandably a bit sloppy - behind and enter the world of physics.

  It is always a 'joy' to see when students are first confronted with Special relativity, be a both confused, a bit 'but this can not be' and at the same time excited about this new world. The lectures breaks are then filled with students approaching us, sometimes confused, struggling understanding and appreciating the 'weird' consequences, but always eager to understand and learn. We wish for all physics students to get engaged and introduced as soon as possible in this new world.
