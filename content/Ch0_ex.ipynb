    "In physics, we assume that quantities like the speed of light ($c$) and Newton’s gravitational constant ($G$) have the same value throughout the universe, and are therefore known as physical constants. A third such constant from quantum mechanics is Planck’s constant ($\\hbar$ , $h$ an with a bar). In high-energy physics, people deal with processes that occur at very small length scales, so our regular SI-units like meters and seconds are not very useful. Instead, we can combine the fundamental physical constants into different basis values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Physicists often use *dimensionless quantities* to compare the magnitude of two physical quantities. Such numbers have two major advantages over quantities with numbers. First, as dimensionless quantities carry no units, it does not matter which unit system you use, you'll always get the same value. Second, by comparing quantities, the concepts 'big' and 'small' are well-defined, unlike for quantities with a dimension (for example, a distance may be small on human scales, but very big for a bacterium). Perhaps the best known example of a dimensionless quantity is the *Reynolds number* in fluid mechanics, which compares the relative magnitude of inertial and drag forces acting on a moving object:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\label{Reynoldsnumber} \\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\text{inertial forces}}{\\text{drag forces}} = \\frac{\\rho v L}{\\eta} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid (either a liquid or a gas), $v$ the speed of the object, $L$ its size, and $\\eta$ the viscosity of the fluid. Typical values of the viscosity are $1.0\\;\\mathrm{mPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ for water, $50\\;\\mathrm{mPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ for ketchup, and $1.0\\;\\mu\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ for air.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the typical Reynolds number for a duck when flying and when swimming (you may assume that the swimming happens entirely submerged). NB: This will require you looking up or making educated guesses about some properties of these birds in motion. In either case, is the inertial or the drag force dominant?\n",
    "1. Estimate the typical Reynolds number for a swimming bacterium. Again indicate which force is dominant.\n",
    "1. Oil tankers that want to make port in Rotterdam already put their engines in reverse halfway across the North sea. Explain why they have to do so.\n",
    "1. Express the Reynolds number for the flow of water through a (circular) pipe as a function of the radius&nbsp;$R$ of the pipe, the volumetric flow rate (i.e., volume per second that flows through the pipe)&nbsp;$Q$, and the kinematic viscosity&nbsp;$\\nu \\equiv \\eta / \\rho$. \n",
    "1. For low Reynolds number, fluids will typically exhibit so-called laminar flow, in which the fluid particles all follow paths that nicely align (this is the transparent flow of water from a tap at low flux). For higher Reynolds number, the flow becomes turbulent, with many eddies and vortices (the white-looking flow of water from the tap you observe when increasing the flow rate). The maximum Reynolds number for which the flow is typically laminar is experimentally measured to be about 2300. Estimate the flow velocity and volumetric flow rate of water from a tap with a 1.0&nbsp;cm diameter in the case that the flow is just laminar.\n",
