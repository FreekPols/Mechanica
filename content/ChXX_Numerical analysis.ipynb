    "In the examples so far, we looked at 1-dimensional problems, for instance, the falling hail stone. Given the expression for the drag force with the algebraic formula for the drag coefficient, an analytical approach could be tried, although a numerical one turned out to be straightforward. This changes, when we deal with a 2-dimensional trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard classical mechanical example is that of the 'canon ball': a point mass of mass m is shot into the air from $z=0$ with initial velocity $v_0$ at an angle $\\alpha$ with the horizontal. The only force taken into account is gravity and the question is: \"at what value does the ball travel furthest?\" This is a 2-dimensional, which makes it in principle more complicated. However, in this case, the equations for the motion in the horizontal and vertical direction are uncoupled and can be solved separately. it is relatively simple to show that the path is longest at $\\alpha = 45^\\circ$, independent of the initial velocity of the ball.\n",

    "A pendulum is by most people known for its 'clock work'. In old fashioned clocks it swings back and force at a constant period. The small friction it encounters is balanced by a driving force, usually coming from weights that slowly move downwards due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a pendulum can show complex motion if the driving force is not a constant. A very simple example is a pendulum, that experiences some friction that is linearly related to the velocity of the bob and a driving force that is a cosine of time. Mathematically, this can be described by the following equation of motion:\n",

    "$$m \\ddot{x} = -\\gamma \\dot{x}  - \\alpha \\sin (x) + A \\cos (2\\pi ft) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we analyse this equation, we see on the left hand side 'ma' and on the right hand side the forces. That is: friction, the effect of gravity and the driving force. In the current exercise, we set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\gamma = 0.1 s^{-1}, \\alpha = 1 rad/s^2, A = 1 rad/s^2 \\text{ and } 2\\pi f = 1 s^{-1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This symplifies the equation of motion to\n",

    "$$\\ddot{x} = -0.1 \\dot{x} - \\sin (x) + \\cos (t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial conditions are: $x(0) = 0$ and $\\dot{x}(0) = 2.0 $\n",

    "Write a numerical code that solves the above problem and plot $x(t)$ for different values of $\\dot{x}(0)$, namely 1,8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will experience, that small changes in the initial condition have large consequences for the trajectory $x(t)$, which is a characteristic of chaotic systems. And indeed, this pendulum shows chaotic behavior. It is virtually impossible to solve the equation of motion analytical, but a numerical solution is made relatively easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a reliable solution, better numerical schemes than the one we are using here are needed. An example of five different initial conditions giving five different solutions, but now made with higher order schemes, is given in the figure below.\n",
