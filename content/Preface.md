# Open Book MechaRela #

Classical mechanics is the starting point of physics. Over the centuries, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Newton's</a> three fundamental laws formulated around 1687, we have built a solid framework describing the material world around us. On these pages, you will find a text book with animations, demos and exercises for studying introductory classical mechanics. Moreover, we will consider the first steps of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Einstein's</a> Special Theory of Relativity published 1905.

This material is made to support first year students from the BSc Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology during their course *Classical Mechanics and Relativity Theory*, MechaRela for short. But, of course, anybody interested in Classical Mechanics and Special Relativity is more than welcome to use this book.

With this e-book our aim is to provide learning material that is:

* self-contained
* easy to modify and thus improve over the years
* interactive, provide additional demos and exercises next to the lectures




## Demos
```{tip}
Onderstaande nodig? we bouwen een hoop ook zelf
```

Most pages contains some demos and examples. [My physics lab](https://www.myphysicslab.com/) website has many demos on a very diverse set of physics problems. Some we will link at the corresponding page. Visit the demos and play with them, try to understand what is happening and why, have fun!


## Concise Overview on Mechanics

For a most concise overview of the basics click on the image below and scroll over the tiles. This covers the mechanics part of the course only, but this is most often the hardest part of the students.
