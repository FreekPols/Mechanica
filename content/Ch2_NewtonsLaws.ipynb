    "equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on object 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{21} = -\\vec{F}_{12}$$\n",

    "\n",

    "if $ m = const $, then $\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = m\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = m\\vec{a} $.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, in many cases using the momentum representation is beneficial. The reason is that momentum is one of the key quantities in physics. This is due to the underlying conservation law, that we will derive in a minute. Moreover, using momentum allows for a new interpretation of force: force is that quantity that - provided it is allowed to act for some time interval on an object - changes the momentum of that object. This can be formally written as:\n",

    "In Newtons mechanics time does not have a preferential direction. That means, in the equations derived based on the three laws of Newton, we can replace $t$ by $-t$ and the motion will have different sign, but that's it. The path/orbit will be the same, but traversed in opposite direction. Also in special relativity this stays the same.\n",

    "## Notes on vector notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Position, velocity, momentum, force: they are all vectors. In physics we will use vectors a lot. It is important to use a proper notation to indicate that you are working with a vector. That can be done in various ways, all of which you will probably use at some point in time. We will use the position of a particle located at point P as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position vector\n",
    "We write the position**vector** of the particle as $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "This vector is a 'thing', it exists in space independent of the coordinate system we use. All we need is an origin that defines the starting point of the vector and the point P, where the vector ends.  \n",
    "A coordinate system allows us to write a representation of the vector in terms of its coordinates. For instance, we could use the familiar Cartesian Coordinate system {x,y,x} and represent $\\vec{r}$ as a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{r} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "          x \\\\\n",
    "          y \\\\\n",
    "          z\n",
    "    \\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could use unit vectors in the x, y and z-direction. These vectors have unit length and point in the x, y or z-direction, respectively. They are denoted in varies ways, depending on taste. Here are 3 examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split}\n",
    "\\hat{x},\\;\\; \\hat{i}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_x \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y},\\;\\; \\hat{j}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_y \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{z},\\;\\; \\hat{k}, &\\;\\;\\vec{e}_z\n",
    "\\end{split} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation, we can write the position vector $\\vec{r}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{split}\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\hat{x} \\;+ y \\hat{y} \\;+ z \\hat{z} \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\hat{i}\\;\\; + y \\hat{j}\\; + z \\hat{k} \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{r} &= x \\vec{e}_x + y \\vec{e}_y + z \\vec{e}_z\n",
    "\\end{split} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are completely equivalent: the difference is in how the unit vectors are named. Also note, that these three representations are all given in terms of vectors. That is important to realize: in contrast to the column notation, now all is written at a single line. But keep in mind: $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ are perpendicular **vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiating a vector \n",
    "\n",
    "We often have to differentiate physical quantities: velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time; acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. But you will also come across differentiation with respect to position.  \n",
    "As an example, let's take velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{v} \\equiv \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean? Differentiating is looking at the change of your 'function' when you go from $x$ to $x+dx$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{dx} \\equiv \\lim_{\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x ) - f(x)}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In 3 dimensions we will have that we go from point P, represented by $\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z}$ to 'the next point' $\\vec{r} + d\\vec{r}$. The small vector $d\\vec{r}$ is a small step forward in all three directions, that is a bit $dx$ in the x-direction, a bit $dy$ in the y-direction and a bit $dz$ in the z-direction.  \n",
    "Consequently, we can write $\\vec{r} + d\\vec{r}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{r} + d\\vec{r} = x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z} + dx\\hat{dx} + dy\\hat{y} + dz\\hat{z} $$\n",
    "$$= (x+dx)\\hat{x} + (y+dy)\\hat{y} + (z+dz)\\hat{z}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can take a look at each component of the position and define the velocity component as, e.g., in the x-direction\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_x = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac{x(t + \\Delta t ) - x(t)}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this to the 3-dimensional vector, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\vec{v} \\equiv \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{dt} &= \\frac{d}{dt} \\left ( x\\hat{x} + y\\hat{y} + z\\hat{z} \\right ) \\\\\n",
    " &=\\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x} + \\frac{dy}{dt}\\hat{y} + \\frac{dz}{dt}\\hat{z} \\\\\n",
    " &= v_x \\hat{x} + v_y \\hat{y} + v_z \\hat{z}\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the above, we have used that according to the product rule: $\\frac{d}{dt} (x\\hat{x} ) = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x} + x\\frac{d\\hat{x}}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{dt}\\hat{x}$, since $\\frac{d\\hat{x}}{dt} = 0$ (the unit vectors in a Cartesian system are constant). This may sound trivial: how could they change; they have always length 1 and they always point in the same direction. Trivial as this may be, we will come across unit vectors that are not constant as their direction may change. But we will worry about those examples later.\n",

Unfortunately, the answer is not  a 'yes'. \n",

    "In 1795 it was decided that 1 gram is the mass of 1 cm$^3$ of water at its melting point. Later on, the kilogram became the unit for mass. In 1799, the *kilogramme des Archives* was made, being from then on the prototype of the unit of mass. It has a mass equal to that of 1 liter of water at 4$^\\circ$C (when water has its maximum density).\n",

Not by much (on the order of 50 micrograms), but sufficient to hamper high precision measurements and setting of other standards. In modern physics, the kilogram is now defined in terms of Planck's constant. As Planck's constant has been set (in 2019) at exactly $ h = 6.62607015 \\cdot10^{-34} \\text{kg}\\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $, the kilogram is now defined via $h$, the meter and second. \n",

    "### Eötvös experiment on mass ###\n",
    "The question whether inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same has put experimentalists to work. It is by no means an easy question. Gravity is a very weak force. Moreover, determining that two properties are identical via an experiment is virtually impossible due to experimental uncertainty. Experimentalist can only tell the outcome is 'identical' within a margin. Newton already tried to establish experimentally that the two forms of mass are the same. However, in his days the inaccuracy of experiments was rather large. Dutch scientist Simon Stevin concluded in 1585 that the difference must be less than 5\\%. He used his famous 'drop masses from the church' experiments for this (they were primarily done to show that every mass falls with the same acceleration).\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of years later, Galilei used both fall experiments and pendula to improve this to: less than 2\\%. In 1686, Newton using pendula managed to bring it down to less than 1&permil; .\n",
    "\n",
    "An important step forward was set by the Hungarian physicist, Loránd Eötvös (1848-1918). We will here briefly introduce the experiment. For a full analysis, we need knowledge about angular momentum and centrifugal forces that we will deal with only later in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The experiment\n",
    "The essence of the Eötvös experiment is finding a set up in which both gravity (sensitive to the gravitational mass) and some inertial force (sensitive to the inertial mass) are present. Obviously, gravitational forces between two objects out of our daily life are extremely small. This will be very difficult to detect and thus introduce a large error if the experiment relies on measuring them. Eötvös came up with a different idea. He connected two different objects with different masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, via a (almost) massless rod. Then, he attached a thin wire to the rod and let it hang down. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sensitive device: any mismatch in forces or torques will have the setup either tilt or rotate a bit. Eötvös attached a tiny mirror to one of the arms of the rod. If you shine a light beam on the mirror and let it reflect and be projected on a wall, then the smallest deviation in position will be amplified to create a large motion of the light spot on the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Eötvös experiment](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s-experiment) two forces are acting on each of the masses: gravity, proportional to $m_g$, but also the centrifugal force $F_c = m_i R \\omega^2$, the centrifugal force stemming from the fact that the experiment is done in a frame of reference rotating with the earth. This force is proportional to the inertial mass. The experiment is designed such that if the rod does not show any rotation around the vertical axis, then the gravitational mass and inertial mass must be equal. It can be done with great precision and Eötvös observed no measurable rotation of the rod. From this he could conclude that the ratio of the gravitational over inertial mass differed less from $1$ than $ 5 \\cdot 10^{-8}$. Currently, experimentalist have brought this down to $ 1 \\cdot 10^{-15}$.\n",

If that was the case but the ratio would always be the same, then we would just rescale $m_g$, that is redefine the value of the gravitational const $G$ to make $m_g$ equal to $m_i$. No, the question is whether these two properties are separate things, like mass and charge. We can have two objects with the same inertial mass but give them very different charges. In analogy: if $m_i$ and $m_g$ are fundamentally different quantities then we could do the same but now with inertial and gravitational mass.\n",
