    "## Calculus\n",
    "Most of the undergraduate theory in physics is presented in the language of Calculus. We do a lot of differentiating and integrating. And for good reasons. The basic concepts and laws of physics can be cast in mathematical expressions, providing us the rigor and precision that is needed in our field. Moreover, once we have solved a certain problem using calculus, we obtain a very rich solution, usually in terms of functions. We can quickly recognize and classify the core features, that help us understanding the problem and its solution much deeper. As a simple example, let's look at a particle of mass $m$, that has initially (say at $t=0$) a velocity $v_0$. For $t>0$ the particle is subject to a force that is of the form $F = - b v$. This is a kind of frictional force: the faster the particle goes, the larger the opposing force will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to know how the position of the particle is as a function of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can answer this question by applying Newton 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m\\frac{dv}{dt} = F \\Rightarrow m\\frac{dv}{dt} + bv = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, we have to solve a differential equation which states that if you take the derivative of $v$ you should get something like $- v$ back. From calculus we know, that exponential function have the feature that when we differentiate them, we get them back. So, we will try $v(t) = A e^{-\\mu t}$ with $A$ and $\\mu$ to be determined constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We substitute our trial $v$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m \\cdot A \\cdot -\\mu e^{-\\mu t} + b \\cdot A e^{-\\mu t} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This should hold for all $t$. Luckily, we can scratch out the term $e^{-\\mu t}$, leaving us with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-m A \\mu + Ab = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see, that also our unknown constant $A$ drops out. And, thus, we find\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu = \\frac{b}{m} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to find $A$: for that we need an initial condition, which we have: at $t=0$ is $v=v_)$. So, we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t) = A e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t} \\text{   and  } v(0)=v_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above we see: $A = v_0$ and our final solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t) = v_0 e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the solution for $v$, we easily find the position of $m$ as a function of time. Let's assume that the particle was in the origin at $t=0$, thus $x(0)=0$. So, we find for the position\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dx}{dt} \\equiv v = v_0 e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t} \\Rightarrow x = v_0 \\cdot \\left ( -\\frac{m}{b}e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t} \\right ) + B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We find $B$ with the initial condition and get as final solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\frac{m v_0}{b} \\left ( 1 - e^{-\\frac{b}{m}t} \\right ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we inspect and assess our solution (see Python script below), we see: the particle slows down (as is to be expected with a frictional force acting on it) and eventually comes to a stand still. At that moment, the force has also decreased to zero, so the particle will stay put.\n",

    "Of course, now that we have the analytical solution, there is nothing to add or gain from a numerical analysis. Nevertheless, it is instructive to see how we could have dealt with this problem using numerical techniques. One way of solving the problem is, to write a computer code (e.g. in python) that computes from time instant to time instant the force on the particle, and from that updates the velocity and subsequently the position.\n",

    "\n",
    "This expression forms the heart of our numerical approach. We will compute $v$ at discrete moments in time: $t_i = 0, \\Delta t, 2\\Delta t, 3\\Delta t, ...$. We will call these values $v_i$. Note that the force can be calculated at time $t_i$ once we have $v_i$. Thus our calculation scheme becomes (with $F = -b v$):\n",

We will assume that the hail stone is formed in a cloud at a height of 1km above the ground. Furthermore, we will take that the stone drops from that height with zero initial velocity. Finally, we will assume that the problem is 1-dimensional: the hail stone drops vertically down and experiences only gravity, buoyancy and air-friction.

    "You will experience, that small changes in the initial condition have large consequences for the trajectory $x(t)$, which is a characteristic of chaotic systems. And indeed, this pendulum shows chaotic behavior. It is virtually impossible to solve the equation of motion analytical, but a numerical solution is made relatively easily.\n",

    "Note that for a reliable solution, better numerical schemes than the one we are using here are needed. An example of five different initial conditions giving five different solutions, but now made with higher order schemes, is given in the figure below.\n",
