  In this part we cover the fundamentals of Classical Mechanics. We discuss the three laws of Newton and their first consequences. This part focusses on the primary concepts and quantities: Force, Work, Energy, Angular Momentum. We derive and discuss the conservation equations of these and their applications. Two topics receive special attention: oscillations and collisions. We restrict the discussion to one-dimensional cases as much as possible to help understand the physics and not get lost in multi-dimensional problems at an early stage. However, more-dimensionality is not avoided as, for instance, it should be clear from the start that physics not only deals with numbers (better: scalars) but equally important, if not more important, with vectors. Moreover, angular momentum and torque by their very nature require multi-dimensional thinking.

  There are also subjects that we don't touch upon. We will not deal with rigid bodies (although some of the ideas are met when talking about kinetic energy: its translational versus rotational flavors). Rigid bodies require a higher level of abstract thinking and will take up quite some time that is not available in most introductory courses on Classical Mechanics. Nor will we discuss non-inertial frames of reference and fictitious forces like the centrifugal and Coriolis Force. This is left for later years.
