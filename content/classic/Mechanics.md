Summary
 
In this Book we cover the fundamentals of Classical mechanics. We discuss the three laws of Newton and their first consequences. The book focusses on the primary concepts and quantities: Force, Work, Energy, Angular Momentum. We derive and discuss the conservation equations of these and their applications. Two topics receive special attention: oscillations and collisions. We restrict the discussion to one-dimensional cases as much as possible to help students understand the physics and not get lost in multi-dimensional problems at this early stage of their physics education. However, more-dimensionality is not avoided as, for instance, it should be clear from the start that physics not only deals with numbers (better: scalars) but equally important, if not more important, with vectors. Moreover, angular momentum and torque by their very nature require multi-dimensional thinking.

There are also subjects that we don't touch upon. We will not deal with rigid bodies (although some of the ideas are met when talking about kinetic energy: its translational versus rotational flavors). Rigid bodies require a higher level of abstract thinking and will take up quite some time that is not available in most introductory courses on Classical Mechanics. Nor will we discuss non-inertial frames of reference and fictitious forces like the centrifugal and Coriolis Force. In stead we opted for Special Relativity as the third part of the course. In our opinion it is very stimulating for freshmen students do dive into the fascinating world of Einstein and his Relativity Theory. Moreover, Special Relativity is mathematically 'light'. But it has strange, counterintuitive consequences. Via these, we can show the students that it is really beneficial to work with a solid framework and to follow a rigorous approach when dealing with questions and problems. It helps student to leave their High School approach, which is understandably a bit sloppy, behind and enter the world of physics.
It is always a joy to see the students, when first confronted with Special relativity, be a both confused, a bit 'but this can not be' and at the same time excited about this new world. The breaks in the lectures are then filled with students approaching us, sometimes confused, struggling understanding and appreciating the 'weird' consequences, but always eager to understand and learn. We wish for all physics students to get engaged and introduced as soon as possible in the is new world.
