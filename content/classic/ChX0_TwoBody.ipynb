    "# Two Body Problem: Kepler revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton must have realized that his analysis of the Kepler laws was not 100% correct. After all, the sun is not fixed in space and even though its mass is much larger than any of the planets revolving it, it will have to move under the influence of the gravitational force by the planets. Take for example, the sun and earth as our system. By the account of Newton's third law, the Earth exerts also a force on the Sun. Therefore, the Sun has to move as well; thus, we must revisit the Earth-Sun analysis and incorporate that the Sun isn't fixed in space.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Center of Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now logical to assign the total mass $M=m_1+m_2$ to this fictitious particle. It has momentum $\\vec{p}_1+\\vec{p}_2$ which we can also couple to its mass $M$ and assign a velocity $\\vec{V}$ to it such that $\\vec{P}=M\\vec{V}$. Furthermore, if this fictitious mass has velocity $\\vec{V}$, we can also assign a position to it. After all, $\\vec{V} = \\frac{d\\vec{R}}{dt}$, which gives us the recipe for the position $\\vec{R}$.\n",

    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last equation, we have an integration constant in the form of a vector, $\\vec{C}$. We are free to choose it as we want: its precise value does not affect the velocity $\\vec{V}$ nor the momentum $\\vec{P}$ of our fictitious particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense, to choose: $\\vec{C} = 0$ and thus define as position of the particle:\n",

    "$$ \\vec{R} = \\frac{m_1 \\vec{x}_1 + m_2 \\vec{x}_2}{m_1 + m_2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a few arguments: \n",
    "1)  if the particles are actually each half of a real particle, we obviously require that $\\vec{R}$ is the position of the real particle.\n",
    "2)  If the particles are separate by a small distance, we would like to have the fictitious particle somewhere in between the two. Moreover, if the two particles are identical, it makes sense to have the fictitious particle right in between them: the system is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, in general is the position $\\vec{R}$?    That can be easily seen from the figure below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, the last part of the above equation tells us: first go to $m_1$ and then, 'walk' a fraction $\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} $ of the line connecting $m_1$ and $m_2$. If you have done that, you are at position $\\vec{R}$.  \n",
    "Note: if $m_1 = m_2$ this recipe indeed brings us right between the two particles.  \n",
    "Further note: the position of $M$ is always on the line from $m_1$ to $m_2$. If $m_1$ is much larger than $m_2$, it will be located close to $m_1$ and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call this position the **center of mass**, or CM for short. Reason: if we look at the response of our two particle system to the forces, it is as if there is a particle $M$ at position $\\vec{R}$ that has all the momentum of the system.\n",

One can also look for periodic changes in the brightness of a star (which is much, much harder than looking at spectral shifts of the light).
