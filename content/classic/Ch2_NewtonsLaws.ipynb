    "\n",
    "Now we turn to one of the most profound breakthroughs in the history of science: the laws of motion formulated by Isaac Newton. These laws provide a systematic framework for understanding how and why objects move, and form the backbone of classical mechanics. Using these three laws we can predict the motion of a falling apple, a car accelerating down the road, or a satellite orbiting Earth (though some adjustments are required in this context to make use of e.g. GPS!). More than just equations, they express deep principles about the nature of force, mass, and interaction.\n",

    "In 1661, he started studying at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1665, the university temporarily closed due to an outbreak of the plague. Newton returned to his home and started working on some of his breakthroughs in calculus, optics and gravitation. Newton's list of discoveries is unsurpassed. He invented calculus (at about the same time and independent of Leibniz). Newton is known for 'the binomium of Newton', the the cooling law of Newton. He proposed that light is made of particles. And he formulated his law of gravity. Finally, he postulated his three laws that started classical mechanics and worked on several ideas towards energy and work. Much of our concepts in physics are based on the early ideas and their subsequent development in classical mechanics. The laws and rules apply to virtually all daily life physical phenomena and only do they require adaptation when we go to very small scale or extreme velocities and cosmology. In what follows, we will follow his footsteps, but in a modern way that we owe to many physicist and mathematicians that over the years shaped the theory of classical mechanics in a much more comprehensive form. We do not only stand on shoulders of giants, we stand on a platform carried by many.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting to know is that his mentioning of *standing on shoulders* can be interpreted as a sneer towards Robert Hooke (1635-1703), with he was in a [fight with over several things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Hooke_priority_controversy_for_the_inverse_square_law). Hooke was a rather short man... See, e.g., {cite:t}`gribbin2019scientists`.\n",

    "Why? There is another property of objects, also called mass, that is part of Newton's Gravitational Law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two bodies of mass $ m_1 $ and $ m_2 $ that are separated by a distance $r_{12}$ attract each other via the so-called gravitational force ($\\hat{r}_{12}$ is a unit vector along the line connecting $m_1$ and $m_2$):\n",

If you find that confusing, think about inertia and electric forces. Two particles with each an electric charge, $q_1$ and $q_2$, respectively exert a force on each other known as the Coulomb force:\n",

How fast it will respond to this force of another charged particle depends on $m$. If $m$ is big, the particle will only get a small acceleration; the strength of the force does not depend on $m$ at all. So far, so good. But what about $m_g$? That property of a particle that makes it being attracted to another particle with this same property, that we could have called 'gravitational charge'. It is clearly different from 'electrical charge'. But would it have been logical that it was also different from the property inertial mass, $m_i$? \n",

    "\n",
    "One powerful way to describe how a force acts at different locations in space is through the concept of a **force field**. A force field assigns a force vector (indicating both direction and magnitude) to every point in space, telling you what force an object would experience if placed there.\n",

    "The question whether inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same has put experimentalists to work. It is by no means an easy question. Gravity is a very weak force. Moreover, determining that two properties are identical via an experiment is virtually impossible due to experimental uncertainty. Experimentalist can only tell the outcome is 'identical' within a margin. Newton already tried to establish experimentally that the two forms of mass are the same. However, in his days the inaccuracy of experiments was rather large. Dutch scientist Simon Stevin concluded in 1585 that the difference must be less than 5\\%. He used his famous 'drop masses from the church' experiments for this (they were primarily done to show that every mass falls with the same acceleration).\n",

    "An important step forward was set by the Hungarian physicist, LorÃ¡nd EÃ¶tvÃ¶s (1848-1918). We will here briefly introduce the experiment. For a full analysis, we need knowledge about angular momentum and centrifugal forces that we do not deal with in this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The experiment**  \n",
    "The essence of the EÃ¶tvÃ¶s experiment is finding a set up in which both gravity (sensitive to the gravitational mass) and some inertial force (sensitive to the inertial mass) are present. Obviously, gravitational forces between two objects out of our daily life are extremely small. These will be very difficult to detect and thus introduce a large error if the experiment relies on measuring them. EÃ¶tvÃ¶s came up with a different idea. He connected two different objects with different masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, via a (almost) massless rod. Then, he attached a thin wire to the rod and let it hang down. \n",

If you shine a light beam on the mirror and let it reflect and be projected on a wall, then the smallest deviation in position will be amplified to create a large motion of the light spot on the wall.\n",

    "In [EÃ¶tvÃ¶s experiment](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s-experiment) two forces are acting on each of the masses: gravity, proportional to $m_g$, but also the centrifugal force $F_c = m_i R \\omega^2$, the centrifugal force stemming from the fact that the experiment is done in a frame of reference rotating with the earth. This force is proportional to the inertial mass. The experiment is designed such that if the rod does not show any rotation around the vertical axis, then the gravitational mass and inertial mass must be equal. It can be done with great precision and EÃ¶tvÃ¶s observed no measurable rotation of the rod. From this he could conclude that the ratio of the gravitational over inertial mass differed less from $1$ than $ 5 \\cdot 10^{-8}$. Currently, experimentalist have brought this down to $ 1 \\cdot 10^{-15}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The question is not if $m_i / m_g$ is different from 1. If that was the case but the ratio would always be the same, then we would just rescale $m_g$, that is redefine the value of the gravitational const $G$ to make $m_g$ equal to $m_i$. No, the question is whether these two properties are separate things, like mass and charge. We can have two objects with the same inertial mass but give them very different charges. In analogy: if $m_i$ and $m_g$ are fundamentally different quantities then we could do the same but now with inertial and gravitational mass.\n",
