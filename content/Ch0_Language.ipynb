    "# The language of Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is the science that seeks to understand the fundamental workings of the universe: from the motion of everyday objects to the structure of atoms and galaxies. To do this, physicists have developed a precise and powerful language: one that combines mathematics, both colloquial and technical language, and visual representations. This language allows us not only to describe how the physical world behaves, but also to predict how it will behave under new conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce the foundational elements of this language, covering how to express physical ideas using equations, graphs, diagrams, and words. You’ll also get a first taste of how physics uses numerical simulations as an essential complement to analytical problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This language is more than just a set of tools—it is how physicists *think*. Mastering it is the first step in becoming fluent in physics."

Finally, we will assume that the problem is 1-dimensional: the jumper drops vertically down and experiences only gravity, buoyancy and air-friction. \n",

That can be done in various ways, all of which you will probably use at some point in time. We will use the position of a particle located at point P as an example.\n",

    "#### Differentiating a vector \n",

    "We often have to differentiate physical quantities: velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time; acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. But you will also come across differentiation with respect to position.  \n",

The small vector $d\\vec{r}$ is a small step forward in all three directions, that is a bit $dx$ in the x-direction, a bit $dy$ in the y-direction and a bit $dz$ in the z-direction.  \n",
    "Consequently, we can write $\\vec{r} + d\\vec{r}$ as\n",

This may sound trivial: how could they change; they have always length 1 and they always point in the same direction.
